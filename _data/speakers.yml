  topic: A Novel Bayesian Model to Fit Spectrophotometric Data of Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes
  proposal_summary: Understanding how the most massive galaxies rapidly formed and quenched when Universe was only ~3 billion years old is one of the major challenges of extragalactic astronomy.
    In this talk, I will discuss how to improve our understanding of massive galaxy formation by combining the spectro-photometric observations of the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes for strong gravitationally lensed galaxies.
    In particular, a multi-level regression model is built that can fit all multi-wavelength data for a range of instruments within a hierarchical Bayesian framework to constrain the properties of the stellar populations.
    The details of how this model is implemented using PyMC3, as well as the estimates of the posteriors of all parameters of interest and nuisance parameters will be highlighted.

  topic: "calibr8: Going beyond linear ranges with non-linear calibration curves and multilevel modeling"
  proposal_summary: "You just coded up a beautiful model and dummy prediction looks great.
    Now comes the data, but wait: the units don't match!
    And to make matters worse, the correlation between model variable and measurement readout is non-linear and heteroscedastic!
    Sounds familiar? non-linear calibration to the rescue! With `calibr8`, we present a statistical framework and corresponding open source Python package that solves non-linear calibration and likelihood functions for modeling.
    From a laboratory automation and systems biology perspective, the advantage of non-linear calibration with `calibr8` is two-fold:
    For lab scientists doing (high-throughput) experiments, `calibr8` facilitates more intuitive uncertainty quantification and makes every-day data analysis more robust, automatable and Bayesian.
    From a modeling perspective, non-linear _error models_ are essential components of realistic Bayesian process models, and are key to accurately describe the nastiest step of the data-generating process.
    In this talk, we will take you step-by-step through the data-generating process of an automated bioassay and demonstrate how its non-linearities are modeled with `calibr8`.
    We will show how `calibr8` can make your life easier - and of course more Bayesian - even if you don't always go all the way to a process model.
    Finally, we will show how non-linear error models and multi-level modeling with `PyMC3` enable you to get more information out of heterogeneous regression analyses.
    Join us for the talk and discussion to learn about building Bayesian models for bioassays and dive into the fascinatingly frightening world of non-linear measurement errors!"

    Bayesian methods therefore play an important role in many aspects of ML.

    Sounds familiar? non-linear calibration to the rescue!
    With `calibr8`, we present a statistical framework and corresponding open source Python package that solves non-linear calibration and likelihood functions for modeling.
    From a laboratory automation and systems biology perspective, the advantage of non-linear calibration with `calibr8` is two-fold:
    For lab scientists doing (high-throughput) experiments, `calibr8` facilitates more intuitive uncertainty quantification and makes every-day data analysis more robust, automatable and Bayesian.
    From a modeling perspective, non-linear _error models_ are essential components of realistic Bayesian process models, and are key to accurately describe the nastiest step of the data-generating process.
    In this talk, we will take you step-by-step through the data-generating process of an automated bioassay and demonstrate how its non-linearities are modeled with `calibr8`.
    We will show how `calibr8` can make your life easier - and of course more Bayesian - even if you don't always go all the way to a process model.
    Finally, we will show how non-linear error models and multi-level modeling with `PyMC3` enable you to get more information out of heterogeneous regression analyses.
    Join us for the talk and discussion to learn about building Bayesian models for bioassays and dive into the fascinatingly frightening world of non-linear measurement errors!"

    He likes to work with robots, bacteria and models as much as he loves to work in enthusiastic teams.
    As a PhD student in laboratory automation for bioprocess development at Forschungszentrum Jülich, he writes software to make robots generate his data.
    Since he unit-tests his code, he always blames the robots if the data doesn't agree with his Bayesian models."

  topic: "Forward sampling in PyMC"
  proposal_summary: "PyMC is great for infering parameter values in a model given some observations, but sometimes we also want to generate random samples from the model either as predictions given what we already inferred from the observed data, or we just want to generate synthetic data that's compatible with the model we built. These two kinds of sampling are called posterior predictive and prior predictive sampling, and are collectively called forward sampling. Forward sampling can be hard. The typical problems that show up are related to shape mismatches in hierarchical models, latent categorical values that aren't correctly re-sampled or changing the shape of the data between the training and test phases. In this talk I'll talk about how forward sampling is implemented in PyMC3 and PyMC4, and give some tips on how to deal with the typical problems that show up when we want to generate forward samples."

  topic: Estimating the Causal Network of Developmental Neurotoxicants using PyMC3
  proposal_summary: There is a vital need for alternative methods to animal testing to assess compounds for their potency of inducing developmental neurotoxicity such as learning disabilities in children.
    However, data are often limited and complex in structure. Therefore, Bayesian approaches are perfect to unravel their meaning and create predictive models.
    In this talk, I will showcase a multilevel probabilistic model and outline how to deal with unbalanced, correlated and missing values.
    This presentation will be of interest for those willing to learn multilevel modelling in PyMC3,
    how to deal with missing values for both predictors and outcomes of data matrices,
    and their application to a real problem in toxicology.
